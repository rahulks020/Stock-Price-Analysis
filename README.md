Stock Price Analysis using Linear Regression

Stock price prediction is a difficult task, since it very depending on the demand of the stock, and there is no certain variable that can
precisely predict the demand of one stock each day. However, Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) said that stock price also depends on new 
information significantly. One of many information sources is people's opinion in social media. People's opinion about products from 
certain companies may determine the company's reputation and thus affecting people's decision to buy the stock of the company. 

There are many method to predict stock prices like -Multiple regression,SVM,Tensor Flow ,etc.Our experiment shows that prediction models
using previous stock price and hybrid feature as predictor gives the best prediction with some coefficient of determination. 

Here i am using Linear regression to predict prices on the basis of previous prices using the most fitting line  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression

It is very simple method to predict stock.
